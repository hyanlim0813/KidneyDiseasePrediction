# Kidney Disease Prediction
This project aims to help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients early by predicting the likelihood of kidney disease based on medical data using machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from here:
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/336/chronic+kidney+disease)

**Features**: Age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cells, pus cell clumps, bacteria, blood glucose random, blood urea, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, appetite, pedal edma, anemia

**Target**: Class

## Modelling Approach
In this project, 5 machine learning models were explored, including:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Tree Classifier

3. Random Forest Classifier

4. K-nearest neighbors

5. Support Vector Machine

## Results
**Best Model**: Logistic Regression & SVM
Accuracy: 1.00

Precision: 1.00

Recall: 1.00

F1-score:1.00

**!!Potential Overfitting!!**

## Future Work:

-External Validation

-Cross Validation

**This project uses some ideas from the following source:**
